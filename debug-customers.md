# Customer Creation Debug

## Issue
The customer creation button is not responding, and the customers page shows "Loading customers..."

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Authentication**: The API requires authentication
2. **Check Browser Console**: Added console.log statements to debug
3. **Check API Response**: Test direct API calls

## Instructions to Debug

1. **Open Browser Developer Tools**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard/customers
   - Press F12 to open dev tools
   - Go to Console tab

2. **Check for Errors**:
   - Look for any red error messages
   - Check if there are 401 Unauthorized errors
   - Look for the console.log messages we added

3. **Test Customer Creation**:
   - Click "Add Customer" button
   - Fill in the name field (required)
   - Click "Create" button
   - Check console for our debug messages:
     - "Attempting to save customer: {formData}"
     - "Making request to: /api/customers with method: POST"
     - "Response status: XXX"

4. **Possible Issues**:
   - **401 Unauthorized**: User not logged in
   - **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or server issue
   - **Network Error**: Connection issue

## Quick Test

You can also test the API directly by running:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/customers
```

If you get `{"message":"Unauthorized"}`, then the user needs to log in first.

## Solution Steps

If you see authentication errors:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Sign in or register an account
3. Then go to customers page
4. Try creating a customer

The debug logs will show exactly what's happening.
